; Potential Latin Translations for "Per-Unit"
; If you are looking for a Latin-based term for a factor from 0 to 1 (like a percentage but normalized to 1.0), here are the most accurate translations:
; Per Unum: Literally "by/through one". This is the most direct parallel to per centum (per 100).
; Per Unitatem: "Through unity" or "by means of unity". Unitatem is the accusative form of unitas (unity).
; Pro Portione: "In proportion" or "as a share". While less "math-heavy," it carries the meaning of a part relative to a whole.
; Neologizing a Symbol
; In engineering, "per-unit" is already used as a system of measurement, but it lacks a single elegant symbol like %, usually being abbreviated as pu or p.u.. To create a new symbol, you could follow the evolutionary logic of existing signs:
; The "Single-Dot" Percent: The percent sign (%) evolved from per cento or p.c., eventually becoming two circles separated by a slash. A "per-one" symbol could be a single circle with a slash (e.g., ⦂ or % with one zero removed) to visually represent "out of one" instead of "out of 100."
; Ligature of "U": Following the ampersand (& from et) or the pound (£ from L), a stylized "U" (for Unum or Unitatem) with a horizontal strike-through (like U or Ꝅ) would match the historical pattern of scribal abbreviations.
; The "Unity Slash": A vertical bar with a small subscript "1" or dot (e.g., |. or /₁) could denote a normalized factor.
; The Circle-Dot (⊙): In some contexts, a dot inside a circle represents a "unit" or "whole." It is distinct, simple, and implies a contained value between 0 and 1.
